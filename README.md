Movie Trailer project - Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree


Project submission


In order to run correctly, all of these file (sans readme) should be placed in the same 
folder.

The file that will actually initiate the movie trailer web page is entertainment_center.py.

This should be opened in IDLE (Python 2.7) and run from there. Alternatively, one could
run this from the command line as well.
