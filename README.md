Movie Trailer project

Project submission

This project is designed to display a web page with some information of some of my favorite movies. Basic information is displayed beneath the poster; a trailer for the movie will play if one clicks on the movie poster.


In order to run correctly, all of these file (sans readme or with the readme if you are feeling lucky) should be placed in the same folder.

The file that will actually initiate the movie trailer web page is entertainment_center.py. However, all of the files are necessary for entertainment_center.py to run correctly.

This file should be opened in IDLE (Python 2.7) and run from there. I am not responsible for any bad things that occur should you attempt to run this in Python 3.x... Wars have started from less blatant transgressions.

Alternatively, one could run this from the command line as well. This is really neat as it simulates a poor man's time machine.

Picture this:
	One moment you are merrily typing away in the console as if it were 1982; dot-matrix printers (and pre-psycho Michael Jackson) are singing away merrily in the background. Then, after ever so briefly typing out, "When this baby hits 88 miles per hour..." Sorry! Wrong command. Where were we? Oh, yes. After typing out the seemingly innocuous command, "python entertainment_center.py" you are whisked into a world of html, css and youtube!

Amazing and heady stuff!

Anyway, you probably want to actually run this program one of these days.

Regardless of your desired method of turning loose the bonds straining in withholding the awesomeness of my project (and run-on sentences) you should prepare to be amazed.

INSTALLATION:

In order to run do the following:

Download the culmination of my life's work to a folder of your choice.

	Choice 1:
		Open IDLE(PythonGUI) (version 2.7)
		Select: --> File --> Open
		Navigate to folder where you downloaded these files
		--> Open --> entertainment_center.py
		When files opens in IDLE:
		Press F5 or select --> Run --> Run Module

If that does not work, or you would prefer the aforementioned time-machine experience, then enter the folder from the command line and type the following at the command prompt:

	$ python entertainment_center.py

Once the page is displayed in your default browser you can click on the movie posters to bring up the movie trailers.

Be advised that the immediate after-effects of undergoing such a shock to your system might result in the page returning to what seems to be a normal, fairly basic, website with a few movies listed. You should know beforehand that this is one of your brain's defense mechanisms... Just know that, although you have absolutely no recollection afterwards, you have experienced something that many people only dream about.

Thank you for taking the time to review my project! It has been a lot of fun!
