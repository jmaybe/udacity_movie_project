Movie Trailer project - Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree


Project submission


In order to run correctly, all of these file (sans readme) should be placed in the same 
folder.

The file that will actually initiate the movie trailer web page is entertainment_center.py.

This should be opened in IDLE (Python 2.7) and run from there. Alternatively, one could run this from the command line as well.

In order to run do the following:

	Right click on: entertainment_center.py
	Select: IDLE from the ‘open with’ options
	When opened in IDLE press F5 or ‘run -> run module’ from pull-down list.

If that does not work then enter the folder from the command line and type the following at the command prompt:
	
		python entertainment_center.py

Once the page is displayed in your default browser you can click on the movie posters to bring up the movie trailers.
